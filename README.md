# Arudino_Projects
A couple of different Arduino projects for working with different electronic components (ultrasonic sensors, RFID readers, etc.)

The individual projects include:
1. RFID (recognize users based on UID)
2. Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (turn on certain LEDs based on an object's distance from an ultraonic      sensor)
